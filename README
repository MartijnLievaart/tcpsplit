# tcpsplit
A tool to split a pcap file into seperate tcp streams.

This  tool aimes  to  do one  job  right, split  a  capture file  into
different tcp streams.

One goal was to create as little dependencies as practical, so it's as
easy as possible ot  deploy.  It's written in C++ so  it needs the C++
RTL and obviously it needs libpcap. But that is it.
